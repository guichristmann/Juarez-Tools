# Description
This repository contains the barebones original DARwIn-OP Framework (Action Editor, Dxl Monitor, Offset Tuner and Walk Tuner) and extensions for Python 2, compiled as a shared library (called darwin_motions).

I've used this to program a heavily modified DARwIn OP1 (called Juarez), which the original Fit-PC doesn't work anymore.

## Requirements
In order to compile the Python module in a modern (64-bit Ubuntu for example) you need to use gcc and g++ 4.8.

* apt-get install gcc-4.8
* apt-get install g++-4.8
* apt-get install libjpeg62-dev
